## Issues
1. I ran into general issues quite a bit; however, the lecture really helped me to troubleshoot the errors that I found.

## Resources
1. The lecture was my main resource. I also did various Google searches to get a better understanding of how certain things work. These searches mostly led to:
[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and
[Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
